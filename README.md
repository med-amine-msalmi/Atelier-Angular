# Angular CRUD Workshop
### Angular CRUD application using Services, Dependency Injection, and JSON Serve

## 📌Description
This project is an Angular CRUD application developed as part of a workshop. It demonstrates how to manage products using Angular, Services, Dependency Injection, and JSON Server as a mock backend

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

 - **Angular**
 - **TypeScript**
 - **JSON Server**
 - **Angular**
   
 - **HttpClient**
   
 - **Bootstrap**



## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

- Understand CRUD operations

- Use Angular services

- Apply Dependency Injection

- Communicate with a backend using HTTP

- Manage data using JSON Server

## Angular CRUD Application

A CRUD application allows managing data through four basic operations:

➕ Create

Send an HTTP POST request from Angular to store a new product in the database.

📖 Read

Use an HTTP GET request to retrieve products and display them in components.

✏️ Update

Send an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to update an existing product.

❌ Delete

Send an HTTP DELETE request to remove a product from the database.

### Architecture
🔹 Frontend (Angular)

Angular runs in the browser and handles:

UI rendering

Navigation

Forms

Client-side logic

🔹 Backend (JSON Server)

JSON Server acts as a REST API that:

Stores data in db.json

Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

🔄 Angular ↔ Backend Communication

Angular uses services and the HttpClient module to communicate with the backend.
